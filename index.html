							<p>Very helpful! My house was in a less than popular area but he really pushed it and found me a buyer for a good price and terms that were really good for me. Highly recommend Realtor Freddy Beltran to work with! I worked with Freddy Beltran to sell my home in San Antonio and buy another one on the other side of town. He quickly found me a good buyer and helped me negotiate a good price and terms that were really good for me. Then we went out and found a new home in a lovely neighborhood that exactly matched what I wanted. I even had a hangup where the sellers didn't fulfill their contract and he went to bat hard for me and got things resolved very quickly. Highly recommended!</p>
